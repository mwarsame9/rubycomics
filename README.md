# Rubycomics

Web comics using Ruby. This application allows users to view comics as guest users or view, create, delete and update as a registered user. When registering, user must provide name, username and password.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubycomics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubycomics

## Usage

Open up the application in your browser. As guest user, click on thumbnails to open and view each page. You can also create an account which allows you to add, delete, and update comic pages.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
